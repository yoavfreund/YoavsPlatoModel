\section{Conclusion}
As we have explained, combining signal processing and databases enables DBMSs that not only support spatiotemporal data but also leverage reduced-noise additive models to offer efficient and noise-free query processing. In the future, we plan to investigate whether models can be used not only as intermediate blocks enabling query processing but also as query results that provide insights into the structure of the data (e.g.,  correlations, dominant frequencies, etc.).
